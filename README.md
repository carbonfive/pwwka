This gem connects to a topic exchange on a RabbitMQ server. It gives any app using it the ability to do two things:

* Transmit messages to the exchange
* Receive messages from the exchange and tell the exchange whether or not the message has been acknowledged.

Any app can do one or both of these things.

The basic principle of the Pwwka Message Bus is this:

> The transmitter should send messages to inform anyone who listens that an event has occurred. It's up to the receiver to interpret the message.

As an example:

* public-app sends a message that a new client has signed up
* admin-app receives that message and updates its client index
* email-app receives that message and sends a welcome email to the client

## Persistence

All transmitters and receivers share the same exchange. This means that all receivers can read all messages that any transmitter sends. To ensure that all messages are received by eveyone who wants them the Pwwka message bus is configured as follows:

* The exchange is named and durable. If the service goes down and restarts the named exchange will return with the same settings so everyone can reconnect.
* The receiver queues are all named and durable. If the service goes down and restarts the named queue will return with the same settings so everyone can reconnect, and with any unacknowledged messages waiting to be received.
* All messages are sent as persistent and require acknowledgement. They will stick around and wait to be received and acknowledged by every queue that wants them, regardless of service interruptions.


## Setting it up

### Install RabbitMQ locally

```
brew install rabbitmq
```

And follow the instructions.

### Adding it to your app

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'pwwka'
```


### Set up your pwwka configration

Connect to your RabbitMQ instance using the url and choose a name for your
topic exchange.

In `config/initializers/pwwka`:

```ruby
require 'pwwka'
Pwwka.configure do |config|
  config.rabbit_mq_host      = ENV['RABBITMQ_URL']
  config.topic_exchange_name = "mycompany-topics-#{Rails.env}"
  config.options             = {allow_delayed: true}
end
```

## Sending a message

You can send any kind of message using `Pwwka::Transmitter.send_message!`:

```ruby
payload = {client_id: '13452564'}
routing_key	= 'sf.clients.client.created'
Pwwka::Transmitter.send_message!(payload, routing_key)
```
The payload should be a simple hash containing primitives. Don't send objects because the payload will be converted to JSON for sending. This will blow up if an exception is raised. If you want the exception to be rescued and logged, use this instead:

```ruby
Pwwka::Transmitter.send_message_safely(payload, routing_key)
```

You can also use the two convenience methods for sending a message. To include these methods 
in your class use:

```ruby
include Pwwka::Handling
```

Then you can call:

```ruby
send_message!(payload, routing_key)
```

### Error Handling
This method accepts several strategies for handling errors, pass in using the `on_error` parameter:

  * `:raise`: Log the error and raise the exception received from Bunny. (default strategy)
  * `:ignore`: Log the error and return false.
  * `:resque`: Log the error and return false. Also, enqueue a job with Resque 
    to send the message. See `send_message_async` below.

### Delayed Messages
You might want to delay sending a message (for example, if you have just created a database 
record and a race condition keeps catching you out). In that case you can use delayed message 
options:

```ruby
payload = {client_id: '13452564'}
routing_key	= 'sf.clients.client.created'
Pwwka::Transmitter.send_message!(payload, routing_key, delayed: true, delay_by: 3000)
```

`delay_by` is an integer of milliseconds to delay the message. The default (if no value is set) is 5000 (5 seconds).

These extra arguments work for all message sending methods - the safe ones, the handling, and the `message_queuer` methods (see below).


### Sending message Async with Resque

To enqueue a message in a background Resque job, use `Transmitter.send_message_async` 
```ruby
Pwwka::Transmitter.send_message_async(payload, routing_key, delay_by_ms: 5000) # default delay is 0
```

If `Resque::Plugins::ExponentialBackoff` is available, the job will use it.
Customize the backoff intervals using the configuration `send_message_resque_backoff_strategy`.
The default backoff will retry quickly in case of an intermittent glitch, and then every ten 
minutes for half an hour.
 
The name of the queue created is `pwwka_send_message_async`.


### Message Queuer
You can queue up messages and send them in a batch. This is most useful when multiple messages 
need to sent from within a transaction block.
  
For example:

```ruby
# instantiate a message_queuer object
message_queuer  = MessageQueuerService.new
ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
  # do a thing, then queue message
  message_queuer.queue_message(payload: {this: 'that'}, routing_key: 'go.to.there')

  # do another thing, then queue a delayed message
  message_queuer.queue_message(payload: {the: 'other'}, routing_key: 'go.somewhere.else', delayed: true, delay_by: 3000)
end
# send the queued messages if we make it out of the transaction alive
message_queuer.send_messages_safely
```

## Receiving messages

The message-handler comes with a rake task you can use in your Procfile to start up your message handler worker:

```ruby
message_handler: rake message_handler:receive HANDLER_KLASS=ClientIndexMessageHandler QUEUE_NAME=adminapp_style_index ROUTING_KEY='client.#.updated'
```

* `HANDLER_KLASS` (required) refers to the class you have to write in you app (equivalent to a `job` in Resque)
* `QUEUE_NAME` (required) we must use named queues - see below
* `ROUTING_KEY` (optional) defaults to `#.#` (all messages)

You'll also need to bring the Rake task into your app.  For Rails, you'll need to edit the top-level `Rakefile`:

```ruby
require 'pwwka/tasks'
```

### Queues - what messages will your queue receive

It depends on your `routing_key`. If you set your routing key to `#.#` (the default) it will receive all the messages. The `#` is a wildcard so if you set it to `client.#` it will receive any message with `client.` at the beginning. The exchange registers the queue's name and routing key so it knows what messages the queue is supposed to receive. A named queue will receive each message it expects to get once and only once.

The available wildcards are as follows (and are not intuitive):
* `*` (star) can substitute for **exactly one word**.
* `#` (hash) can substitute for zero or more words.

__A note on re-queuing:__ At the moment messages that raise an error on receipt are marked 'not acknowledged, don't resend', and the failure message is logged. All unacknowledged messages will be resent when the worker is restarted. The next iteration of this gem will allow for a specified number of resends without requiring a restart.

__Spinning up some more handlers to handle the load:__ Since each named queue will receive each message only once you can spin up multiple process using the *same named queue* and they will share the messages between them. If you spin up three processes each will receive roughly one third of the messages, but each message will still only be received once.

### Handlers

Handlers are simple classes that must respond to `self.handle!`. The receiver will send the handler three arguments:

* `delivery_info` - [a bunch of stuff](http://rubybunny.info/articles/queues.html#accessing_message_delivery_information)
* `properties` - [a bunch of other stuff](http://rubybunny.info/articles/queues.html#accessing_message_properties_metadata)
* `payload` - the hash sent by the transmitter

Here is an example:

```ruby
class ClientIndexMessageHandler
  
  def initialize(payload)
    @payload = payload
  end

  def self.handle!(delivery_info, properties, payload)
    # for this handler we only care about the payload
    handler = new(payload) 
    handler.do_a_thing
  end

  def do_a_thing
    ###
    # some stuff that is being done
    ###
  end

end
```

#### Handling Messages with Resque

If you use [Resque][resque], and you wish to handle messages in a resque job, you can use `Pwwka::QueueResqueJobHandler`, which is an adapter between the
standard `handle!` method provided by pwwka and your Resque job.

1. First, modify your `Gemfile` or otherwise arrange to include `pwwka/queue_resque_job_handler`:

   ```ruby
   gem 'pwwka', require: [ 'pwwka', 'pwwka/queue_resque_job_handler' ]
   ```

   or, in `config/initializers/pwwka.rb`:

   ```ruby
   require 'pwwka/queue_resque_job_handler'
   ```

2. Now, configure your handler.  For a `Procfile` setup:
   
   ```
   my_handler: rake message_handler:receive HANDLER_KLASS=Pwwka::QueueResqueJobHandler JOB_KLASS=MyResqueJob QUEUE_NAME=my_queue ROUTING_KEY="my.key.completed"
   ```

   Note the use of the environment variable `JOB_KLASS`.  This tells `QueueResqueJobHandler` which class to queue.
3. Now, write your job.

   ```ruby
   class MyResqueJob
     @queue = :my_resque_queue

     def self.process(args) # i.e. payload
       user = User.find(args.fetch("user_id")) # or whatever
       user.frobnosticate!
     end
   end
   ```

   Note that you must provide `@queue` in your job.  `QueueResqueJobHandler` doesn't support setting a custom queue and enqueue-time (PRs welcome :).
   Note further that your job class is not given the routing key, so you'll have to set `ROUTING_KEY` appropriately for whatever it is you're trying to
   do.
3. Profit!

## Monitoring

RabbitMQ has a good API that should make it easy to set up some simple monitoring. In the meantime there is logging and manual monitoring.

### Logging

The receiver logs details of any exception raised in message handling:

```ruby
error "Error Processing Message on #{queue_name} -> #{payload}, #{delivery_info.routing_key}: #{e}"
```

The transmitter will likewise log an error if you use the `_safely` methods:

```ruby
error "Error Transmitting Message on #{routing_key} -> #{payload}: #{e}"
```

If your payloads are large, you may not want to log them 2-3 times per message.  In that case, you can adjust `payload_logging` in the configuration:

```ruby
Pwwka.configuration.payload_logging = :info # The default - payloads appear at INFO and above log levels
Pwwka.configuration.payload_logging = :error # Only log payloads for ERROR or FATAL messages
Pwwka.configuration.payload_logging = :fatal # Only log payloads for FATAL messages
```

### Manual monitoring

RabbitMQ has a web interface for checking out the health of connections, channels, exchanges and queues. Access it via the Heroku add-ons page for Enigma.

## Testing

This gem has test coverage of interacting with RabbitMQ, so for unit tests, your best
strategy is to simply mock calls to `Pwwka::Transmitter`.

For integration tests, however, you can examine the actual message bus by setting up
the provided `Pwwka::TestHandler` like so:

```ruby
require 'pwwka/test_handler'

describe "my integration test" do

  before(:all) do
    @test_handler = Pwwka::TestHandler.new
    @test_handler.test_setup
  end

  after(:all) do 
    # this clears out any messages, so you have a clean test environment next time
    @test_handler.test_teardown 
  end

  it "uses the message bus" do
    post "/items", item: { size: "L" }

    message = @test_handler.pop_message

    expect(message.delivery_info.routing_key).to eq("my-company.items.created")
    expect(message.payload).to eq({ item: { id: 42, size: "L" } })
  end

  it "can splat the values as well" do
    post "/items", item: { size: "L" }

    delivery_info, payload = @test_handler.pop_message

    expect(delivery_info.routing_key).to eq("my-company.items.created")
    expect(payload).to eq({ item: { id: 42, size: "L" } })
  end
end
```

The pwwka gem has tests for all its functionality, so testing your app is best done with mocks on this gem. 

However, if you want to test the message bus end-to-end in your app you can use some helpers in `lib/pwwka/test_handler.rb`. See this gem's specs for examples of how to use them.
